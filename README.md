## Introduction

This project aims to showcase how to structure and write end-to-end tests using Cypress and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. POM is a design pattern that helps create a clear structure for the test code by separating the representation of the page (Page Objects) from the test scripts.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kang111/cypress-pom-projectone.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
3. Project Structure
   The project structure is organized as follows:

   ```sh
